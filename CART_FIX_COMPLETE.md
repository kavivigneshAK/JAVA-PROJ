# ✅ Cart Functionality - FIXED & COMPLETE

## 🔧 What Was Fixed

### Issue Found
The cart page was showing an error because the **remove cart item endpoint** was missing from CartController.

### Solution Applied

#### 1. **Added Remove Cart Item Endpoint**
**File:** `src/main/java/com/example/bookshop/controller/CartController.java`

Added the missing endpoint:
```java
@PostMapping("/cart/remove/{itemId}")
public String removeFromCart(@PathVariable Long itemId) {
    cartItemRepository.deleteById(itemId);
    return "redirect:/cart";
}
```

Also added `CartItemRepository` dependency injection to support this functionality.

#### 2. **Enhanced Order Entity**
**File:** `src/main/java/com/example/bookshop/entity/Order.java`

Added timestamp tracking:
```java
@Column(name = "order_time")
private LocalDateTime orderTime;

@PrePersist
protected void onCreate() {
    orderTime = LocalDateTime.now();
}
```

This ensures every order has a creation timestamp automatically.
