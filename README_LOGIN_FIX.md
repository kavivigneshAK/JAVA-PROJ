## ⚙️ Prerequisites

Before running, make sure:

1. **MySQL is running**
   ```bash
   # Windows
   net start MySQL80
   ```

2. **Database exists**
   ```bash
   mysql -u root -p
   CREATE DATABASE bookshop;
   EXIT;
   ```

3. **Database credentials match** (in `src/main/resources/application.properties`)
   ```properties
   spring.datasource.username=root
   spring.datasource.password=mysql123
   ```

---

## 🔧 If Login Still Doesn't Work

### Check 1: Verify MySQL Connection
```bash
mysql -u root -p -e "SELECT * FROM bookshop.users;"
```

You should see the admin and user records.

### Check 2: Check Application Logs
Look for these messages when app starts:
```
✓ Admin user created: admin / admin123
✓ Test user created: user / user123
```

### Check 3: Clear Browser Cache
- Press `Ctrl + Shift + Delete` in browser
- Clear cookies and cache
- Try login again

### Check 4: Try Different Port
If port 8080 is in use, add to `application.properties`:
```properties
server.port=8081
```

Then access: http://localhost:8081/login
