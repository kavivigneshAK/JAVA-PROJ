# âœ… File Upload Error - FIXED

## ðŸ”´ Error Found

**Error Message:**
```
java.nio.file.NoSuchFileException: 
C:\Users\HP\AppData\Local\Temp\tomcat.8080.../src/main/resources/static/images
```

**Location:** Admin add book page - file upload

**Cause:** The upload directory didn't exist, and the code didn't handle optional file uploads.

---

## âœ… Solution Applied

### Fixed BookController.java

**Changes Made:**

#### 1. Made File Upload Optional
```java
@RequestParam(value = "coverFile", required = false) MultipartFile file
```

#### 2. Added Directory Creation
```java
// Create directory if it doesn't exist
Files.createDirectories(Paths.get(uploadDir));
```

#### 3. Added Error Handling
```java
if (file != null && !file.isEmpty()) {
    try {
        // Create directory if it doesn't exist
        Files.createDirectories(Paths.get(uploadDir));
        
        String filename = file.getOriginalFilename();
        file.transferTo(new File(uploadDir + filename));
        book.setCoverImage(filename);
    } catch (IOException e) {
        // If file upload fails, continue without image
        System.err.println("Failed to upload file: " + e.getMessage());
    }
}

bookService.addBook(book);
```

**What it does:**
- Makes file upload optional (not required)
- Creates the upload directory if it doesn't exist
- Handles upload errors gracefully
- Allows adding books without images
- Continues even if upload fails
